Hi there! I am Guan-WeiðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my personal website.

I'm currently pursuing my PhD at the University of Texas at Austin, where I specialize in developing advanced machine learning models for pattern recognition, uncertainty quantification, and efficient data-driven simulations. My expertise lies in **scientific machine learning**, **statistical modeling**, and tackling diverse **data science and analytic challenges**.

When Iâ€™m not working on research, you can find me watching **Starcraft 2** tourments or hitting the **gym**. Feel free to explore and reach outâ€”I'd love to connect!

</p>
