<p>Hi there! I am Guan-Wei ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my personal website.</p>

<p>
I'm currently pursuing my PhD at the University of Texas at Austin, where my expertise lies in <strong>scientific machine learning</strong>, <strong>statistical modeling</strong>, and tackling diverse <strong>data science and analytic challenges</strong>.
</p>

<p>
When Iâ€™m not working on research, you can find me watching <strong>Starcraft 2</strong> tournaments or hitting the <strong>gym</strong>. Feel free to explore and reach outâ€”Iâ€™d love to connect!
